            <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> (Urdu: محمد علی جناح; [mʊɦəmːəd̪ əli
            d͡ʒɪnɑː(ɦ)]; born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11
            September 1948) was a barrister, politician and the founder of
            Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League
            from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and
            then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his
            death. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a
            barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to
            India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in
            national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice.
            Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the
            first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his
            political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to
            shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India
            Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah
            became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed
            a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the
            political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920,
            however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow
            a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
